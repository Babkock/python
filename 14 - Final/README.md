# Python Final Project: GUI Calculator

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Babkock/python/master/14%20-%20Final/screenshot.png)

This is a simple 10-key calculator that can perform four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on integers and decimals. To clear the currently displayed number, simply click the field where it appears to reset it to 0.

This calculator handles division by zero by putting -1 in the display.

This calculator should be able to handle any number you can think of. You will only be able to input numbers up to 10 million, and only up to 6 decimal places. This limit is here because the number will outgrow its area, and you won't be able to read it.
